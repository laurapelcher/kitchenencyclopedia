   <p><i>The Kitchen Encyclopedia</i> was written in 1911 by an unknown author and published by the Swift & Co company in support of their product: Swift’s Premium Oleomargarine. The book is 31 pages and filled with helpful household tips, recipes and information about the uses of oleomargarine. Interspersed throughout are suggestions- some are subtle, most are not- of oleomargarine’s practicality and naturalness. It is aimed at the housewife who is looking to save money without sacrificing quality, tradition or pride. </p>

 <p>The early 1900’s marked a period of creativity in advertising and the birth of what was dubbed, “reason-why copy.” Copy in ads were being utilized for more than just brand-name recognition; admakers were recognizing the potential of copy to overcome resistance and subtly appeal to emotion.  In 1904, chief copywriter John E. Kennedy stated, “Advertising is salesmanship in print.”  Also in 1911, J. Walter Thompson copywriter Helen Lansdowne made waves with her ad for Woodbury’s facial soap, “a skin you love to touch” along with the photo of an embracing couple. The suggestion of sex in this ad is considered a landmark in the field.</p> 

<p>Look through some of the excerpts from <i>The Kitchen Encyclopedia</i> on this site. You will find helpful information about meat cuts, recipes that feature Oleomargarine and a little history of the product. Notice how this helpful “encyclopedia” is savvy in its product integration and promotion of brand trust. The subtext throughout is the promise of a company to support a housewife in taking care of a household and upholding tradition through a product that had not yet gained public trust. It is distinct from today's advertising in the length and comprehension of the content, the outdated gender roles and the old-fashioned recipes. 
However, it appeals to ideals that we have today, for example- natural products at affordable prices and it is sophisticated in its recognition of the consumer.
