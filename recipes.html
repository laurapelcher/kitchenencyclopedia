    <p>You can make exactly as good cakes, pies, cookies, and candies by substituting for the butter named in your recipes ¾ the quantity of Swift's Premium Oleomargarine. On this and the following pages are a few recipes in which this substitution has been made. Try them. You will find them good and more economical than when made with butter.</p>

<p></p>You may have some favorite recipes that are too expensive on account of the large amount of butter required. You can reduce their cost by using Swift's Premium Oleomargarine.</p>

        <h2>Sugar Cookies</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cupful Swift's Premium Oleomargarine</li>
            <li>1 cupful sour milk</li>
            <li>1 teaspoonful soda</li>
            <li>2 cupfuls sugar</li>
            <li>3 eggs, well beaten</li>
            <li>Flavoring to taste</li>
            <li>Flour enough to roll out thin</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Cream the oleomargarine and sugar. Add the eggs, whites and yolks beaten together. Dissolve the soda in the sour milk. Add this and then the flour. Roll out thin. Just before cutting out the cookies sift granulated sugar on top and roll it in slightly, then cut out cookies with cookie-cutter and bake in a moderate oven.</p>

<h2>Butter Scotch</h2>
<ul>
    <li>¾ cupful Swift's Premium Oleomargarine</li>
    <li>1 cupful molasses</li>
    <li>2 cupfuls sugar</li>
    <li>⅓ cupful vinegar</li>
</ul>
<p>Put all together and cook, stirring all the time. Cook until brittle when dropped in cold water. Pour into buttered tins and mark for breaking before it is cold.</p>
<h2>Cornbread</h2>
<ul>
    <li>¼ cupful Swift's Premium Oleomargarine
</li>
<li>1 cupful sweet milk</li>
<li>1 cupful cornmeal</li>
<li>¼ cupful sugar</li>
<li>1 cupful flour</li>
<li>2 teaspoonfuls baking-powder</li>
<li>2 eggs</li>
</ul>
<p>Sift together meal, flour, baking-powder, and sugar. To this add in order the milk, the egg-yolks well beaten, the oleomargarine melted and lastly the well-beaten whites of the eggs. Bake in a hot oven for thirty to thirty-five minutes. This is particularly delicious if just before it is done half a cupful of cream is poured over the top.

</p>
<h2>Lemon Pie</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 cupful sugar</li>
    <li>2 tablespoonfuls flour</li>
    <li>Yolks of three eggs</li>
    <li>1 cupful water</li>
<li>Juice and grated rind of 1 lemon</li>
<li>A lump of Swift's Premium Oleomargarine the size of an egg</li>
<p>Put all together in an oatmeal cooker and cook over hot water until thick. Take from the fire and cool a little. Line a deep pie-plate with crust, pour in the lemon mixture, and bake in a moderate oven until the crust is done. Remove from the oven and have ready the whites of the three eggs, beaten up stiff, with three level tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar; spread this meringue smoothly over the pie, return to the oven, and bake a light brown.
